<h2>1. Intro</h2>
<p>This Quickstart aims to show you the ropes on Linux assembly as quickly as possible.
Basically, it just points out the differences between a Linux and DOS assembly program
with just enough explanation not to confuse you. For more detail and why things are the
way they are, see the Step-by-Step Guide.</p>

<p>Lets compare each part in the two programs:
<ul>
	<li>The first three lines of the DOS program doesn't exist in the Linux program. Linux is a 32-bit
	protected mode operating system, and in 32-bit assembly there are no memory models. Also, all
	segment registers and paging have already been set up to give you the same 32-bit 4Gb address space,
	so you can ignore all segment registers. It is also not necessary to specify the stack size.
	<li>Some differences between the Linux NASM structure and DOS TASM/MASM structure:
	<ul>
		<li>The data / code sections are defined by writing <tt>SECTION .DATA</tt> instead of just
		<tt>.DATA</tt>
		<li>Linux NASM allows us to declare constants with the <tt>EQU</tt> instruction, for example:<br>
		<tt>bufferlen:   equ 400</tt><br>
		So whenever it sees <tt>bufferlen</tt> in your program, it will substitute the value '400'. That
		means you don't have to put square brackets around <tt>bufferlen</tt> to get its actual value.
		(Note: this only works for constants. The values of all other variables are still obtained using
		<tt>[varname]</tt>).
		<li>Another neat NASM feature is the '$' token: when NASM sees an '$' it substitutes it with the
		assembly position at the beginning of that line. So what does this mean? This gives us an easy
		way to define the length of a string we've just declared. After declaring a variable containg a string
		<pre>	hello:     db 'Hello world!',10</pre>
		we can put on the next line
		<pre>	helloLen:  equ $-hello</pre>
		This will make <tt>helloLen</tt> equal to (position at beginning of line) - (position of <tt>hello</tt>).
		If you look at those two lines in the program, you can see this will give us the length of
		<tt>'Hello world!',10</tt>, which is 13 (12 characters plus the linefeed character).<br>
		If this doesn't make sense, don't worry, just know that this is an easy way to define the length of
		a string.
		<li>Strings you want to print out in Linux don't need to be $-terminated like in DOS. Instead, you
		supply the length of the string as one of the parameters. (This is much more flexible, because you
		can now print out only a part of the string, and your computer won't blow up when you forget the $
		like in DOS.)
		<li>To print out a string with a newline at the end, you only need to need to add a linefeed character
		(10) to the end of the string in Linux. In DOS, you need both a linefeed and a carriage return (13).
		<li>The <tt>.CODE</tt> section is called <tt>.TEXT</tt> in Linux
		<li>Right at the beginning of the <tt>.TEXT</tt> section, there must be a declaration specifying
		the entry point of the program: <tt>GLOBAL _START</tt>
		<li>There is no <tt>ASSUME</tt> directive like in the DOS program, because we don't
		need to worry about segments.
		<li>The program's entry point is called whatever you declared it to be at the beginning of
		the <tt>.TEXT</tt> section (in our case it's <tt>_START</tt>). Also, the Linux program doesn't
		end with <tt>END _START</tt> like the DOS program.
	</ul>
	<li>The first two lines after the <tt>START:</tt> label in the DOS program make sure that the DS
	register points to the data segment. Once again, Linux doesn't need this because the segments are
	taken care of for us.
	<li>In 16-bit DOS assembly, we use the normal 16-bit registers AX, BX, CX, DX etc. In 32-bit Linux
	assembly we use the 32-bit extended registers EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX etc. (Note that there is no such
	thing as EAL. AX is the low 16 bits of EAX, while AH is the high 8 bits of AX and AL is the low 8 bits of AX.)
	<li>In DOS, when we want the memory address of a variable to be put in a register, we must use <tt>offset</tt>
	to point to the offset of the variable in the correct segment (<tt>mov dx,offset hello</tt>). In Linux,
	we don't need <tt>offset</tt> because it's implied - we just write <tt>mov ecx,hello</tt>
	<li>In DOS, we call <tt>int 21h</tt> to use a DOS service like printing out a string. In Linux, you use
	system calls, which are accessed by calling <tt>int 80h</tt> (the kernel interrupt). In DOS the function
	number (eg. 9 to print a string) always goes in AX; in Linux it always goes in EAX. As in the example,
	if we want to print out a string we use the  "write" syscall, which is function number 4. We put '4' in EAX,
	the number of the file descriptor to write to in EBX (in this case '1', the screen), the location of the
	string to print in ECX (<tt>mov ecx,hello</tt>), and the length of the string in EDX (<tt>mov ecx,helloLen</tt>).
	Then we call the kernel interrupt (<tt>int 80h</tt>), and voila!
	<li>To exit a Linux program, we use the exit syscall (function 1, so we write <tt>mov eax,1</tt>). We want to
	exit with an exit code of 0 (no error), so we put 0 in EBX. Then we call the kernel with <tt>int 80h</tt> again,
	and we're done.
</ul>
In this case it looks like it's more work than in DOS, but when it comes to creating, reading and writing files,
Linux syscalls are much easier to use than their DOS counterparts.
</p>

<h2>3. More About Linux System Calls</h2>
<p>
There are six registers that are used for the arguments that a system call takes. The first argument goes
in EBX, the second in ECX, then EDX, ESI, EDI, and finally EBP, if there are so many. If there are more than
six arguments, EBX must contain the memory location where the list of arguments is stored.</p>
<p>
All the syscalls are listed in <tt>/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</tt>, together with their numbers.
However, for your convenience you can simply find them in this <a href="syscalls.html">Linux System Call Table</a>,
together with some other useful information (eg. what arguments they take). The syscalls are fully documented
in section 2 of the manual pages, so you can just go <tt>man 2 write</tt> to find out what the write syscall
does, what arguments it takes, etc.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Linux program is much simpler than the DOS one (40 lines in Linux, with liberal
commenting, vs. 66 for DOS). Everything makes sense in the Linux program, whereas a lot of the stuff
in the DOS one still makes me go "Huh?" Lets check out the differences:
<ol>
	<li>Firstly, getting the command line arguments of the Linux program is <i>way</i> easier
	than the DOS one. All the arguments are sitting on the stack when the program starts, so all we
	need to do is <tt>pop</tt> them off. The first value popped off is the number of arguments (called
	argc in C/C++), the second is the name of the program, and finally we get the actual command line
	arguments. Coolest of all, when we pop the command line argument off the stack, it actually puts
	the address of that string in EBX, so once again no segment/offset missions.<br>
	This just took us an entire 3 instructions - compared to the 14 insane ones for the DOS program!
	No messing around with PSPs and stuff - simple, isn't it?
	<li><b>NB:</b> NASM doesn't have procedures like you may have used in TASM. That's because procedures
	don't really exist in assembly: everything is a label. So if you want to write a "procedure" in NASM,
	you don't use <tt>proc</tt> and <tt>endp</tt>, but instead just put a label (eg. <tt>filewrite:</tt>)
	at the beginning of the "procedure's" code. If you want to, you can put comments at the start and end
	of the code just to make it look a bit more like a procedure (like I did in the example).
	<li><b>NB<sup>2</sup>:</b> When you jump to a label with <tt>JMP</tt> or any of the jump instructions,
	you <i>don't</i> <tt>RET</tt> from it. Never! If you're lucky it won't explode on you, but it's
	definitely not right. The only time you <tt>RET</tt> is when you've called the "procedure" with
	<tt>CALL</tt>. Otherwise you're just going to have to jump around like a kangaroo weaving a spaghetti
	code masterpiece. (Note that this is applicable to any assembly, not just Linux or NASM).
	<li>Next we create the file: notice the file permissions in Linux (you can find out more about them
	by reading the creat syscall's manpage &ndash; yes, it is spelled "creat"). Since we want to be smart
	with Linux, why not also include some error checking while we're at it? We can easily check if the
	creat syscall failed by checking the value it returned: if it's less than 0 then something broke, so
	skip the writing part and exit with the error code.
	<li>Now we write 'Hello world!' to the file using the file descriptor (called file handle in DOS)
	returned by the creat syscall. Then we close it, and exit.
</ol>

Not so hectic at all.<br>
<br>
<font size="-1"><u>On the side:</u> If you look at the DOS service functions (int 21h), you may notice that there
are quite a few that have exactly the same names as their Unix/Linux syscall counterparts &ndash; even though
DOS is quite unlike Unix and very much incompatible with it. For example:
DOS 3Ch = CREAT, Unix 08h = creat and DOS 43h = CHMOD, Unix 0Fh = chmod.
Mmm... so where did these DOS functions get their names? From Unix of course! What is really amusing is
that Microsoft never bothered to spell "CREAT" right &ndash; they kept it exactly like Unix's "creat".</font>
</p>

<h2>5. Compiling and Linking</h2>
<p>
To compile a program with NASM:
<pre>nasm -f elf <i>program</i>.asm</pre>
To link the object file produced by NASM into an executable:
<pre>ld -s -o <i>program</i> <i>program</i>.o</pre>
The <tt>-f elf</tt> option tells NASM to compile this in Linux ELF format. This option is necessary because
NASM can compile many different formats (even DOS .COM files if you're so inclined).<br>
The <tt>-s</tt> option for Ld tells it to strip all symbol information (which you don't need) from the output
file. <tt>-o <i>program</i></tt> specifies the name of the output executable file. If you leave it out it
will always be <tt>a.out</tt>
</p>
